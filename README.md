# 🧠 Challenge

Welcome to the **Challenge** repository!

Every day, a new programming challenge is posted on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mrepol742). This repository is where participants submit their solutions.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. A new challenge is posted **daily** in the following format:

   ```js
   // Questions:
   // [The challenge question goes here]

   // Your solution goes below this line

2. Participants solve the challenge and submit a Pull Request (PR) with their solution.
3. The first correct PR submitted for the day is considered the winner 🏆

## 📁 File Structure
Each challenge is represented by a file named after the date it was published:
```
2025-07-12.js
2025-07-13.js
```

## ✅ Rules
- One challenge per day.
- Solutions must be submitted in JavaScript.
- Only PRs with correct and working solutions will be considered.
- The first correct submission wins.
- Keep your code clean, readable, and do not edit other users' solutions.

## 🧑‍💻 Submitting a Solution
- Fork this repository.
- Add your solution
- Open a Pull Request with your solution.
Example:
```
git clone https://github.com/mrepol742/challenge.git
cd Challenge
echo "// Questions:\n// Add two numbers\n\nfunction add(a, b) { return a + b; }" > 2025-07-12.js
git add 2025-07-12.js
git commit -m "Add solution for 2025-07-12"
git push origin master
```
